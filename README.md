# Yoga-pose-detection-
This project uses AI to classify yoga poses and provide corrections. A pre-trained model extracts key points, which are analyzed by an MLP to identify the pose. It compares the test pose to an ideal pose and offers feedback for improvement, combining deep learning and computer vision.
